## Installation

#### Using [CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org/)

First be sure to run `pod repo update` to get the latest version available.

Add `pod 'FYPhoto'` to your `Podfile` and run `pod install`. Also add `use_frameworks!` to the `Podfile`.

```ruby
target 'MyApp'
pod 'FYPhoto'
use_frameworks!
```

#### Using [Swift Package Manager](https://swift.org/package-manager/)

[Swift Package Manager](https://swift.org/package-manager/) (SwiftPM) is a tool for managing the distribution of Swift code as well as C-family dependency. From Xcode 11, SwiftPM got natively integrated with Xcode.

FYPhoto support SwiftPM from version 2.1.0. To use SwiftPM, you should use Xcode 11 to open your project. Click `File` -> `Swift Packages` -> `Add Package Dependency`, enter [FYPhoto repo's URL](https://github.com/T2Je/FYPhoto.git). Or you can login Xcode with your GitHub account and just type `FYPhoto` to search.

After select the package, you can choose the dependency type (tagged version, branch or commit). Then Xcode will setup all the stuff for you.

If you're a framework author and use FYPhoto as a dependency, update your Package.swift file:

``` swift
let package = Package(
    dependencies: [
        .package(url: "https://github.com/T2Je/FYPhoto.git", from: "2.2.9")
    ],
    // ...
)
```



## Plist entries

In order for your app to access camera and photo libraries,
you'll need to ad these `plist entries` :

- Privacy - Camera Usage Description (photo/videos)
- Privacy - Photo Library Usage Description (library)
- Privacy - Microphone Usage Description (videos)

```xml
<key>NSCameraUsageDescription</key>
<string>yourWording</string>
<key>NSPhotoLibraryUsageDescription</key>
<string>yourWording</string>
<key>NSMicrophoneUsageDescription</key>
<string>yourWording</string>
```

## Configuration

All the configuration endpoints are in the [FYPhotoPickerConfiguration](https://github.com/T2Je/FYPhoto/blob/main/FYPhoto/Classes/Configuration/FYPhotoPickerConfiguration.swift).
Below are the default value for reference, feel free to play around :)

### Picker
```swift
var pickerConfig = FYPhotoPickerConfiguration()
// [Edit configuration here ...]
// Build a picker with your configuration
let photoPicker = PhotoPickerViewController(configuration: pickerConfig)
```

#### General
```Swift
pickerConfig.selectionLimit = 0
pickerConfig.supportCamera = true
pickerConfig.mediaFilter = [.image, .video]

// Color
let colorConfig = FYColorConfiguration()
colorConfig.topBarColor = FYColorConfiguration.BarColor(itemTintColor: .red,
                                                        itemDisableColor: .gray,
                                                        itemBackgroundColor: .black,
                                                        backgroundColor: .blue)

// Similar setting code for pickerBottomBarColor and browserBottomBarColor

pickerConfig.colorConfiguration = colorConfig

```

#### Video
```swift
pickerConfig.compressedQuality = .mediumQuality
pickerConfig.maximumVideoMemorySize = 40 // MB
pickerConfig.maximumVideoDuration = 15 // Secs
```

### Browser

```swift
let photoBrowser = PhotoBrowserViewController.create(photos: photos, initialIndex: 0)
let photosBrowser = PhotoBrowserViewController.create(photos: [photo],
                                                      initialIndex: 0) {
            $0
                .buildPageControl()
                .buildBottomToolBar()
                .buildNavigationBar()
                .buildCaption()
                .buildThumbnailsForSelection()
                .showDeleteButtonForBrowser()
                .setMaximumCanBeSelected(1)
        }
```

## Usage

First things first `import FYPhoto`.  

### Picker
```swift
let photoPickerVC = PhotoPickerViewController(configuration: pickerConfig)
    
photoPickerVC.selectedPhotos = { [weak self] images in
//            images.forEach {
//                $0.asset
//                $0.data
//                $0.image
//            }
}

photoPickerVC.selectedVideo = { [weak self] selectedResult in
    switch selectedResult {
    case .success(let video):
//                video.briefImage
//                video.url
    case .failure(let error):
        print("selected video error: \(error)")
    }
}
photoPickerVC.modalPresentationStyle = .fullScreen
self.present(photoPickerVC, animated: true, completion: nil)
```

### Browser
```swift
let image = Photo.photoWithURL(url) // Similar init method for asset, image, data
let photoBrowser = PhotoBrowserViewController.create(photos: [image], initialIndex: 0)
// Use `.fyphoto` to easily bring smoothly drag-drop animation to your app.
self.fyphoto.present(photoBrowser, animated: true, completion: nil)
```
That's it !

## Languages
🇺🇸 English, 🇨🇳 Chinese. 

If your language is not supported, you can submit an issue or pull request with your `Localizable.strings` file to add a new language !

## UI Customization
We tried to keep things as native as possible, so this is done mostly through native Apis.

## References

This project references the following projects:
- [Pixel(has been renamed to Brightroom)](https://github.com/muukii/Brightroom)
- [YPImagePicker](https://github.com/Yummypets/YPImagePicker)
- [JXPhotoBrowser](https://github.com/JiongXing/PhotoBrowser)

## Dependency
FYPhoto relies on [SDWebImage](https://github.com/SDWebImage/SDWebImage) to provide async image downloader with cache support.

## Obj-C support
Objective-C is not supported and this is not on our roadmap.
Swift is the future and dropping Obj-C is the price to pay to keep our velocity on this library :)

## Plan
Add more features to edit photo, include `Filter`, `Mosaic`, etc.

## License
FYPhoto is released under the MIT license. 

## Swift Version
Swift 5.4.
